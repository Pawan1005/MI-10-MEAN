            <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-4">
              Clinic hygiene deals with the recognition and control, but
              primarily with the prevention of hospital infections. In Germany,
              about 900,000 patients contract an illness due to a hospital
              infection every year. This high rate needs to be reduced through
              resolute action. We are committed to that! Our goal is not to
              achieve a germ-free Clinic, but to prevent the development and
              transmission of infections. For this purpose, we develop
              prevention and therapy strategies and apply them in a consistent
              manner. Protecting patients from infections can only succeed if
              all occupational groups involved in patient care are committed to
              hygiene. Hygiene is teamwork. Therefore, the Hospital Hygiene
              Department cannot ensure hygiene at the UKE all by itself. Hygiene
              is everyone’s concern: “One for all. All for hygiene.” That is the
              motto of our hygiene campaign at the UKE.
