    <h2> From the garage to the Googleplex </h2>

    <p>The Goole story begins in 1995 at <strong> Stanford University.</strong> <br>
   <strong> <em> Larry Page </em> </strong> was considering Standford for grad school and <strong> <em>Sergey Brin</em></strong>, a
    student there, was assigned to show him around.</p> 


    <p> By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by 
    following year they struck a <mark>partnership</mark>. <br>
    Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to dertermine
    the importance of individual pages on the <span style="color: blueviolet;"> World Wide Web</span>. </p>

    <p> They called this search engine <em style="background-color: cyan;"> Backrub</em>.</p>
