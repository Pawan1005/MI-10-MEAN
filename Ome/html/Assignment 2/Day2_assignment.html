    <h2>From the garage to the googleplex</h2>

    <p> The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong>Stanford University.</strong><br>
        <b><em>Larry Page</em></b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><em>Sergey Brin</em></b>, a student there, 
        was assigned to show him around.
    </p> 

<p> 
    By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, 
    but by the following year they struck a <mark>partnership</mark>. 
    Working from their dorm rooms, 
    they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the 
    <span style="color:blue">World Wide Web.</span> 
    They called this search engine <em style="background-color: darkgoldenrod;">Backrub</em>.
