    <h1>Google</h1>
    <i>This article is about the company.</i>
    <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
    <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <em>Stanford University.</em><br>
        <em><b>Larry Page </b></em> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b>Sergey Brin</b>, a student <br>
        there, was assigned to show him around.
    </p>
    <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
        year they struck a <mark>partnership</mark>.
    </p>
    <p>Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
        individual <br> 
        pages on the <strong class="imp__text">World Wide Web.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>They called this search engine <em class="search__engineName">Backrub</em>.</p>
