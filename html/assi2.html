        <h1>Google</h1>
        
        <p>This article is about the company.</p> 
        <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
        <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong> Stanford University.</strong>
        <strong> <em>Larry Page</em> </strong> was considering Stanford for grad school and <strong> <em>Sergey Brin</em></strong>, a student
        there, was assigned to show him around.
        By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
        year they struck a <a id="yellow">partnership.</a> 
        Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
        individual pages on the <a id="text">World Wide Web .</a> 
        They called this search engine <a id="blue"> Backrub.</a></p>

        <h2>Initial public offering</h2> 
        
        <p> Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on 19th August 2004.
        At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 30 20
        years, until the year 2024.</p>
