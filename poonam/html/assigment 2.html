            The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong> Stanford University </strong>. <br>
            <b> <em> Larry Page</em> </b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b> <em> Sergey Brin, </em> </b> a student
            there, was assigned to show him around. <br> <br>
            By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
            year they struck a <mark style="background-color: yellowgreen;"> partnership. </mark> <br>
            Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
            individual pages on the <b style="color: darkblue;"> World Wide Web.</b> <br><br>
            They called this search engine <mark style="background-color: blueviolet; font-style: italic;"> Backrub.</mark>
