          Mountaineer <em>Poorna Malavath</em>, 19, is conquering stereotypes
        </h2>
        <p>
          Poorna Malavath, who made history as the youngest person to ever scale
          Mt Everest at 13, hopes to change what is traditionally expected of
          girls through her mountaineering feats.
        </p>
        “I felt I was in heaven,” gushes Poorna Malavath over a video call from
        the US where she is studying. Her broad, toothy smile momentarily
        disappears. She chokes but doesn’t give in to tears.

        <p>
          Geetanjali Rao, who was TIME's First-Ever Kid of the Year, is an
          scientist and inventor.
        </p>
        “Observe, brainstorm, research, build and communicate.” That is what the
        brilliant young scientist and inventor Gitanjali Rao told actor and
        activist Angelina Jolie about her process, over Zoom, from her home in
        Colorado, during a break in her virtual schooling. Just 15 years old,
        Rao has been selected from a field of more than 5,000 nominees as TIME’s
        first ever Kid of the Year. She spoke about her astonishing work using
        technology to tackle issues ranging from contaminated drinking water to
        opioid addiction and cyberbullying, and about her mission to create a
        global community of young innovators to solve problems the world over.
