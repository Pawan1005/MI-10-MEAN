      <em>This article is about the company.</em>
      <br>
    <h3>From the garage to the Googleplex</h3> The Google story begins in 1995 at
    <strong>Stanford University.</strong>
    <br>
    <em>
      <strong>Larry Page</strong>
    </em> was considering Stanford for grad school and
    <em>
      <strong>Sergey Brin,</strong>
    </em> a student there, was assigned to show him around.

    <br /> By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following year
    they struck a

    <mark>partnership</mark>.

    <br> Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
    individual pages on the <span>World Wide Web</span> .
    </p>
    <p> They called this search engine

      <mark>Backrub</mark>.

      <hr>
    <h3>Initial public offering</h3> Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on 19th August
    2004.

    <br> At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for <del>30</del>
    <time>20</time> years, until
    the year 2024.
