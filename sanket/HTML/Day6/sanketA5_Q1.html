      <h4 class="italic">About Me</h4>
      <div class="bg">
        <p>
          I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a
          steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.
          <br />
          I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set
          goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards.
          <br />
          I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of
          tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines.
          <br />
          Iâ€™m a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about
          their lives and their backgrounds.
          <br />
          I am results oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to
          determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to
          make it happen.
