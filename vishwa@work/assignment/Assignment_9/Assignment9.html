        <p>
          Poorna Malavath, who made history as the youngest person to ever scale
          Mt Everest at 13, hopes to change what is traditionally expected of
          girls through her mountaineering feats.

            “I felt I was in heaven,” gushes Poorna Malavath over a video call
            from the US where she is studying. Her broad, toothy smile

            “Observe, brainstorm, research, build and communicate.” That is what
            the brilliant young scientist and inventor Gitanjali Rao told actor
            and activist Angelina Jolie about her process, over Zoom, from her
            home in Colorado, during a break in her virtual schooling. Just 15
            years old, Rao has been selected from a field of more than 5,000
            nominees as TIME’s first ever Kid of the Year. She spoke about her
            astonishing work using technology to tackle issues ranging from
            contaminated drinking water to opioid addiction and cyberbullying,
            and about her mission to create a global community of young
            innovators to solve problems the world over.
